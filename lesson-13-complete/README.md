# Lesson 13 Starter

## Create a project directory and initialize with npm

```sh
mkdir lesson-13
cd lesson-13
npm init # follow prompts
```

*NOTE: you can bypass the prompts with default values by passing the `-y` flag to the `npm init` command*

This will create the `package.json` file in the project directory. Your instructor will examine the file with
you and examine the various sections (name, version, scripts, etc.).

## Install packages

Install the Dayjs package

```sh
npm i dayjs
```

What is the `dayjs` package used for? Check it out on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs).

Install a package for code formatting (we've used ESLint to this point, another great package is Prettier)

```sh
npm i --save-dev prettier
```

*NOTE: you can also use the `-D` in place of `--save-dev` flag to install a devDependency*

Inspect the `package.json` file. What's changed (`dependencies` and `devDependencies`)? What's in the `node_modules` folder. Should `node_modules` be committed to GitHub? How can we prevent files/folders from being included in our GitHub repositories (HINT: `.gitignore`)?

Make the necessary update your project so that `node_modules` won't be included in your GitHub repository.

## Package use

Create a `main.js` file in the project directory. This isn't a typical front-end project, we are just exploring the world of packages, more on the topic of `import`ing and `export`ing will be covered in the next lesson.

```js
// main.js
import dayjs from "dayjs";

const now = dayjs();
console.log("Current Date:", now.format("YYYY-MM-DD"));
console.log("Current Time:", now.format("HH:mm:ss"));
```

## Execute the `main.js` script

From the terminal, execute the script using node:

```sh
node main.js
```

Does it work? What happened?

The `main.js` file is using ES Modules, which aren't enabled by default in node. Let's configure the project to make use of ES Modules. Update the `package.json` file for module support. Insert `"type": "module",` after the `main` property:

```json
{
  "name": "lesson-13-complete",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module"
  ...
```

Now, try to run the script again. You should see the current date and time displayed in the terminal.

Let's format our file with prettier. Run the following in the terminal:

```sh
npx prettier --write .
```

The above command will format and write all updates to files in the current directory `./`. Go ahead and delete the semi-colons in the `main.js` file and run the prettier command again, what happens?

*NOTE: the `npx` command is used to run node scripts (i.e., scripts installed in the local project) that have not been globally installed.*

Prettier can be configured to work with your text editor as well, let's get rid of those double quotes and enforce the use of semicolons. Create the following config file for prettier in the project directory:

```json
// .prettierrc
{
  "useTabs": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

After saving the config file, run the prettier command again to see any updates to the formatting. You can add and change many settings in the file, visit the prettier config settings [options page](https://prettier.io/docs/options) for more.

## Creating and using scripts

The commands we ran above will likely be run many times as work on our project. We can create `scripts` to make running redundant commands easier. Update the `package.json` scripts section with the following:

```json
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node main.js",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
...
```

We won't be using the `test` script, so it can be removed. What we now have are two scripts that can be used to run and format our project, respectively.

*NOTE: notice that npx is not inclued in the script text above. Scripts are assumed to be run in the local project and so don't need the `npx` command*

To run the commands, you use the `npm run <script>` syntax:

```sh
npm run format
npm run start
```

The `start` is a special script name that can be invoked without the `run` flag (`test` is also special in this way). So, the following will also work for the `start` script:

```sh
npm start
```

Neat!

## Managing packages

Sometimes, packages will receive updates that could impact your project. You can update a single package or all packages witht it. Here, we'll update dayjs using the following command:

```sh
npm update dayjs
```

The `update` command will only update minor changes, not major ones. To make an upgrade to a new major version of your package, use the `upgrade` command:

```sh
npm upgrade dayjs
```

The package should already be it's latest major version so running the above command should have no effect.

If you decide you no longer need a package, or no longer have a use for one already installed, you can uninstall them using the `uninstall` command. Let't install and remove an unnecessary package:

```sh
npm i foobar
```

Check `package.json` for the update. Now let's uninstall:

```sh
npm uninstall foobar
```

The package is now removed from the project.

## Push to your GitHub workbook repo

Once you're done making your own custom updates to the project, stage your files, commit your work, and push to the remote repository.

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Stage all updated and created files:
```sh
git add .
```
3. Commit the changes:
```sh
git commit -m 'Lesson 11 Example'
```
4. Push your changes to the remote workbook repository: 
```sh
git push origin main
```
